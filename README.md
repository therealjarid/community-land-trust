## Code Sample

This code excerpt dynamically changes the zoom of the Google Map depending on what pins have been populated. The code measures the horizontal and vertical bounds of the map, then depending on the resolution of the map on the page, changes the zoom accordingly.

The zoom is an interger, so the last line of code removes the decimal place.

`GLOBE_WIDTH` is a constant defined by the Google Maps API, as the base width of the map when zoomed completely out (256px).

```javascript
function calculateZoom(bounds) {
    const GLOBE_WIDTH = 256;
    let angle = bounds.maxLng - bounds.minLng;
    let angle2 = bounds.maxLat - bounds.minLat;
    let delta = -0.5;
    if (angle2 > angle) {
      angle = angle2;
      delta = 2.5;
    }
    if (angle < 0) {
      angle += 360;
    }

    return Math.floor(
      Math.log(($('#map-canvas').width() * 360) / angle / GLOBE_WIDTH) /
        Math.LN2 -
        delta
    );
  }

```
